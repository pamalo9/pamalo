- [Bachelor's Thesis: Trend Prediction in Price Signals with Machine Learning:](https://github.com/pamalo9/TFG) Developed a sophisticated machine learning model capable of predicting market trends by analyzing price signal data. <br>
**Data Sourcing:** Sourced historical financial data from Yahoo Finance, focusing on the calculation of 5-day return periods to transform raw data into actionable insights. Established a multi-class classification system, setting strategic thresholds to define three classes of market trends: gain, flat, and loss.<br>
**Feature Selection and Economic Indicators:** Emphasized the importance of feature selection, identifying key economic indicators critical to the project's predictive accuracy. Engaged in a  study of financial concepts such as volatility, volume, and momentum to inform the model's feature set. <br>
**ML Implementation:** Executed a temporal data split for model training and evaluation, preserving the chronological order of financial time series data. Adopted cross-validation with a sliding window approach for hyperparameter tuning, which is essential for time-series analysis. Experimented with various machine learning algorithms, including Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Logistic Regression, to compare their performance in trend prediction. This process involved a meticulous grid search for hyperparameter optimization, ensuring that the final model was robust and performed consistently across different market conditions.<br><br>

- [Automated Description of Operations Extraction:]()  Collaborated with Coverwallet for the Zrive Applied Data Science program to develop an automated system to extract "description of operations" from companies based on their name and website. The project utilized advanced web scraping, search engine querying, and data summarization techniques to enrich an original database with detailed company descriptions.<br>
 **Data Extraction Engine:** Employed web scraping libraries including Requests, BeautifulSoup, and html2text to gather data, along with search engine APIs from Bing, Google, and Wikipedia to pull relevant company information.<br>
**Summarization and Analysis:** Utilized GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI for generating concise company summaries, comparing its performance with the Hugging Face BART model to ensure accuracy and brevity.<br>
**Infrastructure and Standards Compliance:** Ensured consistency and project isolation by setting up Python 3.11.0 with pyenv, using poetry for dependency management and virtual environment creation. Implemented code standardization with tools such as Black for formatting, Flake8 for linting, and introduced mypy for static type checking.
